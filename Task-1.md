Take the following steps to complete the task:


Get acquainted with the 2 data formats by exploring the files (hint: it's the same message, represented in 2 different formats):
data-1.json
data-2.json
Explore the target unified format by looking at the file data-result.json.


Find the 2 functions in need of implementation and finish them (look for comment lines starting with "IMPLEMENT:").

Use repl.it to run your project and test your solution (look for a big Run button, currently located at the top).

Don't mind the red color of the console output and the message on failed repl process when you run the project - the important thing is to see no failures in the tests.

Successful tests produce output looking similar to this

Ran 3 tests in 0.004s

OK
repl process died unexpectedly: îº§


Hint: notice the timestamps of the 2 telemetry formats are different, but the target format is exactly like one of them (milliseconds). You will need to convert the other format (ISO) to it. Check the resources section for a link to a SO post that can help.

Submit the url to your solution (your public repl project) to finish the task.
to get the url, just open the project in repl.it and copy the content of your browser's address bar/url.
